# hello-world
my first repository
A little bit about me is that I am a student from Cleveland,Ohio. I love to travel and am scuba certified. I am always ready for an adventure and love dogs. I have two mutts that we rescued. 
Some changes I have gone through have been the transition from highschool into college.
